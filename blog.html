            <p>A little bit of commentary about my travels</p>
            <p>I live in New York, but try and get to as many cities as possible in my free time.</p>
            <p>While I have been to other places along my travels with highlights</p>
            <p> such as weekend trips to Atlantic City.</p>
            <p>I have decided to focus on New York, Chicago and Philadelphia
               I'm just here to share what I enjoyed about each city.

            <p>taking in the sights of Times Square,Wall Street,The World Trade Centre</p>

            <p>less crowded, It's a must see for all regardless of the time but it</p>
            <p>really comes to live at night, as the crowds are sparse but the lights</p>

            <p>fields you will see everything from soccer to baseball to volleyball.</p>
            <p>I recommend getting a bike as the park is huge and you reach the zoo</p>

            <p>These reasons include friendly people, the skyline, the lake and of course the pizza, not to mention the fact it is more relaxed than New York
            </p>
            <p>During the summer you can relax at the lake or shop downtown, or even do both as the lake is beside downtown
            </p>
            <p>Chicago is a great place for everyone whether you are here to see one the sport teams, the bridges, the buildings, shopping or for food.

         <h3>Shedd Aquarium</h3>
         <p>Chicago's aquarium is a must see, near to soldier field and the field</p>
         <p>museum. I really enjoyed the whole experience. If you do attend the</p>
         <p>aquarium, a full pass is a must, This pass will give you access to</p>
         <p>all the shows including the Beluga whale and Dolphin shows. This</p>
         <p>pass also allows you go the cinema to see a screening of your choice.</p>
         <p>You need at least half a day to be able to see all the different</p>
         <p>animals, the shark tank is pretty cool as the sharks swim around you</p>
         <p>giving a whole panoramic feeling.You can also pet some of the animals</p>
         <p>such as the sting rays and different fish.</p>

            <p>The Chicago Bears are my favourite team, I have been fortunate to</p>
            <p>meet most of the team so I always try and convert people to the Bears.</p>
            <p>Soldier Field is where the Bears play and you can take a tour of the</p>
            <p>stadium if you are visiting during the off-season or just at a time</p>
            <p>when there is no game,if there is a game you have to go if you can</p>

            <p>80 Bulls games a year with games every few days.This makes getting</p>

            <p>during the season you have a good chance of being able to see a game.</p>

               <p>now both teams suck anyway, so you might as well just choose the</p>

            <p>Philadelphia or the city of brotherly love is the second largest city on the east coast</p>
            <p>I visited Philadelphia for a historical and cultural trip, I learnt more about early American history here on the tours then I did from textbooks</p>
            <p>The best thing about Philadelphia is the fact that the majority of historical and cultural attractions are actually free and run everyday.
            </p>
            <p>And of course Philadelphia has great food.
